# DiveIntoDC

The Dive into DC app allows the user to personalize an itinerary depending on how many days the user will be staying in DC, how many people the user is travling with (alone, in a couple, or with family/group), and how action packed the user wants the itinerary to be. After the user has selected one option from each of the three rows, a personalized itinerary will appear in the div below with the exact location of each place on the map to the right. Each map marker will show the name of the event, the address, and the website to that specific location.

Using the google maps API and the google places API, this map was created. Using the OpenWeatherApp API, the real time DC weather was presented below the map. Using Materialize, the css was adjusted.
